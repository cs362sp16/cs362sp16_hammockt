* endTurn does not clean-up properly *

/ Description /
///////////////

For dominion, endTurn is suppose to emulate dominion's clean-up phase. One rule of the
clean up phase is that, "the player draws a new hand of 5 cards from his Deck. Once the
player has drawn a new hand of 5 cards, the next player starts his turn." This means that
the players hand count should be 5 once he ends his turn (they need cards in their hand
because their are cards that react to the contents of other players hands and their are
trashing cards that remove cards from other players hands). But when endTurn is called,
the player does not have 5 cards in his hand.

/ Code to trigger /
///////////////////

int kCards[10] = {adventurer, gardens, embargo, village, minion, outpost, cutpurse,
				  sea_hag, tribute, smithy};
struct gameState g;
int result;

//for consistancy make randomSeed=1
initializeGame(3, kCards, 1, orig);

//end player 0's turn
endTurn(&g);
assert(g.handCount[0] == 5, "Player 0 did not draw 5 cards");

/////////////////////
/ Severity/Priority /
/////////////////////

The priority and severity are high because this a fundamental rule that has to be true in
order to play dominion, many reaction/trashing cards depend upon the other players having
a proper amount of cards in their hand for them to work, and not drawing the right amount
of cards at the right time screws up the games RNG (causing 2 identical games to have two
different outcomes).
